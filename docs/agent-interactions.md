# Agent Interactions & Responsibilities

## 1. Agent Roles
- **Scheduling Agent**: Handles appointment booking, calendar sync, reminders.
- **Task Management Agent**: Manages to-dos, assignments, progress tracking.
- **Communication Agent**: Sends/receives SMS (Twilio), emails (SendGrid), and manages notifications.
- **Payments Agent**: Processes billing, invoices, and payment status via Stripe.
- **User Profile Agent**: Manages user preferences, permissions, and profile updates.

## 2. Interaction Patterns
- Agents communicate via internal events/messages (e.g., new task triggers reminder scheduling).
- Each agent operates as a stateless microservice, scaling independently.
- Shared database collections (users, tasks, appointments, communications, payments) ensure data consistency.

## 3. Example Interaction Flow
1. User requests appointment via voice/text.
2. NLP/NLU parses intent as 'schedule appointment.'
3. Orchestration Layer delegates to Scheduling Agent.
4. Scheduling Agent checks user preferences, calendar (Google Workspace), proposes slots.
5. Upon confirmation, Communication Agent sends confirmation via SMS/email.
6. Payments Agent is triggered if appointment requires payment.

## 4. Error Handling & Escalation
- Agents send structured error messages to orchestration layer.
- Critical failures logged and optionally notified to admin/support channels.
