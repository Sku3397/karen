# Multi-Agent Orchestrator Logic

## Overview
This module implements a multi-agent orchestrator using the Autogen framework, responsible for:
- Agent registration and lifecycle management
- Task assignment and tracking
- Concurrency and conflict management
- Deadlock detection and avoidance
- Inter-agent communication

## Key Components
- **Orchestrator**: Central manager for agent states and task distribution.
- **BaseAgent**: Abstract agent with core methods for task acceptance and communication.
- **HandymanAgent**: Example specialized agent simulating handyman operations.

## Concurrency & Deadlock Avoidance
- Uses threading and asyncio locks to serialize critical operations.
- Task assignment prefers least-loaded available agents.
- Pending tasks queue prevents resource starvation.
- Placeholders for advanced deadlock detection (e.g., dependency graph analysis).

## Extensibility
- Integrate Firestore for agent/task persistence.
- Extend agents for real external API integration (e.g., Google Calendar, Stripe, Twilio).
