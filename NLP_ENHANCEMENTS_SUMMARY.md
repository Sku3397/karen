# Karen's Enhanced NLP System

## Overview

The enhanced NLP system provides advanced natural language processing capabilities for Karen's handyman business, significantly improving the quality of email responses and customer interaction analysis.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Custom Entity Extraction for Handyman Services

**What it does:**
- Extracts specific handyman service types from customer messages
- Identifies urgency levels (high, medium, low)
- Extracts location information (kitchen, bathroom, garage, etc.)
- Estimates service duration based on service type and description
- Identifies materials that might be needed

**Example:**
```
Input: "Emergency leak in kitchen sink! Water everywhere!"
Output:
- Service Type: plumbing
- Urgency: high
- Location: kitchen
- Estimated Duration: 30 minutes - 1 hour
- Materials: pipe, gasket, seal
```

### 2. Price Extraction and Quote Generation

**What it does:**
- Extracts price information from customer messages ($500, "between $200-400")
- Generates intelligent quotes based on service type and complexity
- Considers urgency multipliers (emergency = 1.5x base rate)
- Includes material cost estimates
- Applies customer-specific discounts for price-sensitive customers

**Example:**
```
Input: "Need electrical work, budget around $300-500"
Output:
- Extracted Budget: $300-$500 range
- Generated Quote: $425 (includes materials and labor)
- Valid Until: 2025-06-11
- Service Breakdown: electrical work (2-4 hours)
```

### 3. Multi-Language Support (Spanish)

**What it does:**
- Detects Spanish language in customer messages
- Provides Spanish translations for common terms
- Generates bilingual responses when needed
- Handles Spanish service terminology

**Spanish Terms Supported:**
- Services: plomería, eléctrico, carpintería, pintura
- Common phrases: emergencia, urgente, cotización, disponible
- Responses: Hola, Gracias, Nos pondremos en contacto

### 4. Conversation Context Memory

**What it does:**
- Tracks conversation history for each customer
- Remembers previous service requests
- Provides contextual suggestions based on history
- Links related service requests

**Example:**
```
Customer Message 1: "Need plumbing help with kitchen sink"
Customer Message 2: "Also bathroom faucet is dripping"
System Response: Suggests combo service, offers maintenance package
```

### 5. Customer Preference Learning

**What it does:**
- Learns customer communication preferences
- Tracks preferred appointment times
- Remembers service history
- Adapts pricing sensitivity
- Adjusts communication style (formal vs casual)

**Learned Preferences:**
- Preferred times: ["morning", "weekday afternoons"]
- Service history: ["plumbing", "electrical"]
- Communication style: "detailed" or "casual"
- Language preference: "en" or "es"
- Price sensitivity: "high", "medium", "low"

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **HandymanNLPEnhancer** (`src/nlp_enhancements.py`)
   - Main NLP processing engine
   - Pattern matching and entity extraction
   - Quote generation algorithms
   - Customer learning system

2. **Enhanced HandymanResponseEngine** (`src/handyman_response_engine.py`)
   - Integrated with existing response engine
   - Enhanced classification with NLP results
   - Multi-language prompt generation
   - Contextual response enhancement

### Pattern Matching System

```python
service_patterns = {
    "plumbing": [
        r"\b(leak|drip|pipe|faucet|toilet|drain|water|clog|unclog)\b",
        r"\b(plumber|plumbing|sink|shower|bathroom)\b",
        r"\b(water damage|flooding|burst pipe)\b"
    ],
    "electrical": [
        r"\b(electric|electrical|wire|wiring|outlet|switch|light|fixture)\b",
        r"\b(breaker|fuse|panel|voltage|electrician)\b",
        r"\b(power out|no power|electrical issue)\b"
    ]
    # ... more patterns
}
```

### Price Extraction Patterns

```python
price_patterns = [
    r"\$(\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?)",  # $1,234.56
    r"(\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?) dollars?",  # 1234.56 dollars
    r"around \$?(\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?)",  # around $1000
    r"between \$?(\d+) and \$?(\d+)",  # between $100 and $200
]
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Response Engine Enhancement

The enhanced system integrates seamlessly with the existing `HandymanResponseEngine`:

```python
# Enhanced classification includes NLP results
classification = {
    'services_mentioned': ['plumbing'],
    'is_emergency': True,
    'extracted_entities': [entity_objects],
    'generated_quote': quote_object,
    'language': 'es',
    'response_suggestions': [suggestions]
}

# Prompt generation includes NLP insights
prompt = generate_enhanced_prompt(email, classification)
```

### Multi-Language Response

```python
if classification['language'] == 'es':
    # Generate Spanish-appropriate response
    response = translate_response(response, 'es')
    signature = "Saludos cordiales,\nKaren"
```
