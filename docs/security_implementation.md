# Security Implementation Guide for AI Handyman Secretary Assistant

## VPC Isolation
Created a dedicated VPC (`ai-handyman-vpc`) with a subnet (`ai-handyman-subnet`) to isolate network traffic.

## Secret Manager
Utilized Google Cloud Secret Manager for storing and accessing sensitive data like API keys securely.

## Encryption and TLS 1.3
Ensured all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3. Configured Cloud Run services to enforce TLS 1.3 for secure communication.

## Conclusion
These implementations enhance the security posture of the AI Handyman Secretary Assistant project by ensuring data is encrypted in transit, network traffic is isolated within a VPC, and sensitive information is securely stored and managed.
