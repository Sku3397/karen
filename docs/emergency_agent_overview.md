# Emergency Response Agent Overview

## Features
- **24/7 Emergency Monitoring:** Background agent monitors Firestore for new emergencies.
- **Escalation Protocols:** Handles severity-based escalation, including authorities if needed.
- **Emergency Contacts:** Looks up and notifies user-specific contacts from the Firestore users collection.
- **Rapid Response Coordination:** Stubs for integrating with Twilio, SendGrid, etc., for real-time alerts.

## Architecture
- `emergency_response_agent.py`: Main agent loop and Firestore interactions.
- `escalation_protocols.py`: Defines escalation logic based on severity.
- `contact_manager.py`: Fetches emergency contacts for users.
- `response_coordinator.py`: Handles (stubbed) notifications and coordination.

## Next Steps
- Integrate with Twilio and SendGrid APIs for live notifications.
- Add thorough error handling and alerting.
- Extend escalation protocols based on customer requirements.
- Add language/localization support as NLP capabilities evolve.
