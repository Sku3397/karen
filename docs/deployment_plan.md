# Deployment Plan for AI Handyman Secretary Assistant (Target Serverless Architecture)

**Note:** This document outlines a deployment plan for a **target/future-state serverless architecture** using services like Google Cloud Run. For considerations related to deploying the **current Celery/Redis-based application**, please refer to the main project `DEPLOYMENT.MD` file in the project root and the `README.md` for operational details.

## Overview of Target Serverless Deployment
The envisioned deployment infrastructure targets multi-region deployment on Google Cloud Run to ensure high availability and scalability. Google Cloud Load Balancing would distribute incoming traffic across the regions. Monitoring would be set up using Google Cloud Monitoring to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

## Planned Implementation Steps for Serverless Deployment
1. Setup a GCP project dedicated to the production environment.
2. Containerize the application components (e.g., FastAPI app, individual Celery tasks if refactored as Cloud Run jobs or separate services).
3. Deploy the application services to Google Cloud Run in multiple regions.
4. Configure a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer in front of the Cloud Run services (especially if exposing API endpoints).
5. Enable Cloud Monitoring for all services to track performance metrics and set up alerts.
6. Implement CI/CD pipelines using Cloud Build or GitHub Actions for automated deployments to Cloud Run.
7. Utilize managed Redis (e.g., Memorystore) if Celery (or a similar task queue) is still part of the serverless architecture for specific background tasks that don't fit a simple Cloud Run request/response model.

## Planned Monitoring Strategy for Serverless Deployment
- Configure dashboards in Cloud Monitoring for real-time insights into Cloud Run services, Load Balancer, etc.
- Set up alerts for error rates, latency, and instance counts.
- Utilize Cloud Logging for aggregated audit logs and application traces from Cloud Run.

## Planned Security Considerations for Serverless Deployment
- Use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for controlling access to any exposed HTTP endpoints.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication, leveraging Google Identity for users and service accounts for intra-service communication.
- Store secrets (API keys, database credentials) in GCP Secret Manager.

This plan focuses on leveraging GCP's fully managed services to minimize operational overhead while ensuring scalability and reliability for the target serverless architecture.
