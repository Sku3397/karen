# Deployment Plan for AI Handyman Secretary Assistant

## Overview
The deployment infrastructure targets multi-region deployment on Google Cloud Run to ensure high availability and scalability. Google Cloud Load Balancing will distribute the incoming traffic across the regions. Monitoring will be set up using Google Cloud Monitoring to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

## Implementation Steps
1. Setup a GCP project dedicated to the production environment.
2. Deploy the application to Google Cloud Run in multiple regions.
3. Configure a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer in front of the Cloud Run services.
4. Enable Cloud Monitoring for all services to track performance metrics and set up alerts.
5. Implement CI/CD pipelines using Cloud Build for automated deployments.

## Monitoring Strategy
- Configure dashboards in Cloud Monitoring for real-time insights.
- Set up alerts for error rates and performance thresholds.
- Utilize Cloud Logging for audit logs and tracing.

## Security Considerations
- Use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) for controlling access to the application.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication, leveraging Google Identity.

This plan focuses on leveraging GCP's fully managed services to minimize operational overhead while ensuring scalability and reliability.
