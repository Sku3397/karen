2. **Integration Points**: 2 files actively using the memory system
3. **Helper System**: Successfully integrated with task queue system

## Features Implemented:

- **Cross-Medium Conversation Tracking**
  - Email conversations
  - SMS conversations  
  - Voice conversations
  
- **Identity Management**

## Helper Functions Available:

```python
from claude_helpers import memory_helper as helper

# Core operations
helper.update_status(status, progress, details)
helper.create_file(path, content)
helper.read_file(path)
helper.search_code(pattern)
helper.send_message(to_agent, msg_type, content)
```

## Current Status:
- Status: active (100%)
