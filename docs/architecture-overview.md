# AI Handyman Secretary Assistant: System Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction
The AI Handyman Secretary Assistant is a cloud-native service that assists users in managing tasks, appointments, communications, and payments. It leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP), integrates with external APIs (Google Workspace, Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid), and supports multi-language interactions.

## 2. High-Level Components
- **API Gateway / REST API**: Entry point for client applications (mobile/web/voice) to interact with backend services.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth2 (Google Identity Platform) for user and agent authentication; role-based access control.
- **Agent Orchestration Layer**: Manages specialized AI agents (e.g., Scheduling Agent, Communication Agent, Task Management Agent) and routes tasks between them.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Implements core logic for scheduling, reminders, notifications, and payment workflows.
- **Database (Firestore)**: Stores user profiles, tasks, appointments, communications, and audit logs.
- **Integration Services**: Handles communication with external APIs:
  - Google Workspace (Calendar, Contacts, Drive)
  - Twilio (SMS/Voice)
  - Stripe (Payments)
  - SendGrid (Email)
- **NLP/NLU Module**: Processes and understands multi-language user input, routes intent to appropriate agent.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Centralized logging, error tracking, and metrics (Stackdriver).

## 3. Data Flow Overview
1. User request received via API Gateway
2. Authenticated and passed to NLP/NLU for intent identification
3. Agent Orchestration Layer routes request to appropriate agent
4. Agents interact with business logic, database, and external APIs as needed
5. Responses consolidated and returned to user

## 4. Key Architectural Considerations
- **Eventual Consistency**: Firestore's consistency model requires conflict resolution strategies for concurrent updates.
- **External API Latency/Availability**: Implement retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation for API failures.
- **Security & Compliance**: Strict permission boundaries, encrypted data-at-rest/in-transit, audit logging, and secure API credential management.
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling via GCP Cloud Functions or Cloud Run microservices.
- **Multi-language Support**: NLP/NLU models must support target languages within training/data constraints.
