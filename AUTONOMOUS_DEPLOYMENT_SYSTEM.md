# Autonomous Deployment System for Karen AI

## 🚀 Overview

The `src/autonomous_deployment.py` module provides a comprehensive Continuous Deployment (CD) system for the Karen AI project, implementing all 5 required capabilities:

## ✅ **Implemented Capabilities**

### 1. **Pre-deployment Test Runner**
- **Multiple Test Suites**: Unit, Integration, System, Health, Agents, Email, SMS
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Prevents hanging test processes
- **Detailed Test Reporting**: Pass/fail counts, duration, error messages, log files
- **Critical Failure Detection**: Stops deployment on critical test failures

```python
test_suites = [TestSuite.HEALTH, TestSuite.UNIT, TestSuite.INTEGRATION, TestSuite.SYSTEM]
report = deployment.deploy(Environment.STAGING, test_suites=test_suites)
```

### 2. **Rollback Mechanism**
- **Automatic Backup Creation**: Before every deployment with manifest files
- **Version-based Rollback**: Restore to specific versions
- **Auto-rollback on Failure**: Configurable automatic rollback when deployments fail
- **Manual Rollback Support**: `rollback_from_backup()` method for manual intervention

```python
# Automatic rollback is enabled by default
config.auto_rollback_on_failure = True

# Manual rollback
rollback_result = deployment.rollback_from_backup(backup_path)
```

### 3. **Health Checks After Deployment**
- **File System Integrity**: Verifies critical files exist
- **Dependencies Check**: Validates Python package dependencies
- **Agent System Health**: Checks agent communication and orchestrator
- **Email/SMS System**: Tests communication channels
- **Configurable Health Checks**: Easy to add new health checks

```python
health_checks = deployment.run_health_checks()
for check in health_checks:
    print(f"{check.check_name}: {check.status}")
```

### 4. **Notification System for Deployments**
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, SMS, Agent broadcasts
- **Status-based Messaging**: Different messages for success/failure/rollback
- **Priority Levels**: Normal, high, critical priority notifications
- **Delivery Tracking**: Records which notifications were sent successfully

```python
notifications = deployment.send_notification(
    "Deployment Complete", 
    "System deployed successfully",
    channels=["email", "agents"],
    priority="normal"
)
```

### 5. **Integration with Agent Orchestrator**
- **Deployment Coordination**: Notifies agents about deployment lifecycle
- **Agent Health Checks**: Requests pre-deployment health status
- **Task Assignment**: Creates deployment-related tasks for agents
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks agent workload during deployments

```python
# Agent coordination is automatic during deployment
coordination_log = deployment.coordinate_with_agents("deployment_start", data)
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Features**

### **Comprehensive Reporting**
- **DeploymentReport**: Complete deployment lifecycle tracking
- **JSON Persistence**: All deployment data saved for analysis
- **Status Retrieval**: Query deployment status by ID
- **Recent Deployments**: List and analyze recent deployment history

### **Error Handling & Resilience**
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if some components fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging at all levels
- **Import Safety**: Handles missing dependencies gracefully
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents hanging operations

### **Configuration Management**
- **Environment Support**: Development, Staging, Production
- **Flexible Test Suites**: Choose which tests to run
- **Directory Management**: Automatic creation of deployment directories
- **Version Detection**: Automatic version detection from git/files

## 📋 **Usage Examples**

### Basic Deployment
```python
from src.autonomous_deployment import AutonomousDeployment, Environment

deployment = AutonomousDeployment()
report = deployment.deploy(Environment.STAGING)
print(f"Deployment {report.deployment_id}: {report.status.value}")
```

### Advanced Deployment with Custom Tests
```python
deployment = AutonomousDeployment()
report = deployment.deploy(
    Environment.PRODUCTION,
    test_suites=[TestSuite.HEALTH, TestSuite.INTEGRATION, TestSuite.AGENTS],
    notification_channels=["email", "sms", "agents"]
)
```

### Deployment Status Monitoring
```python
# Get deployment status
status = deployment.get_deployment_status("deploy_20250604_123456")

# List recent deployments
recent = deployment.list_recent_deployments(limit=5)
for deployment_info in recent:
    print(f"{deployment_info['deployment_id']}: {deployment_info['status']}")
```

## 🔧 **System Requirements**

### **Dependencies**
- **Core**: `pathlib`, `subprocess`, `logging`, `json`, `datetime`
- **Karen AI Modules**: `email_client`, `sms_client`, `agent_communication`, `orchestrator`
- **Configuration**: Proper `.env` setup with required variables

### **Directory Structure**

```

## 🎯 **Testing & Demonstration**

Run the test script to see all capabilities in action:

```bash
python test_autonomous_deployment.py
```

### **Test Results**
```
🚀 AUTONOMOUS DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM TEST

```

## 🔒 **Security & Safety**

- **Backup Verification**: Manifest files ensure backup integrity
- **Rollback Safety**: Multiple rollback attempt limits
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of file permission issues
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents runaway processes
- **Error Boundaries**: Isolated error handling for each component
