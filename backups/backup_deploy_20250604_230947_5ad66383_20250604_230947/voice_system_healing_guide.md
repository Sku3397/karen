### 1. Configure ElevenLabs API Key

**Issue:** The system detected that no ElevenLabs API key is configured, which prevents premium voice generation.

**Healing Action:** Configure the `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable.

**Steps to Apply Healing:**

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable directly
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_api_key_here"

# Option 2: Add to .env file
echo "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here" >> .env

# Option 3: Add to system environment (Windows)
set ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

**To obtain an ElevenLabs API key:**
1. Sign up at https://elevenlabs.io
2. Navigate to your profile settings
3. Generate an API key
4. Copy the key and set it in your environment

**Verification:**
```bash
# Run the voice tests again to verify healing
python run_voice_tests.py
```
