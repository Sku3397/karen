# Security and Input Validation Guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization
- Uses JWT tokens for secure authentication between internal components and API consumers.
- Role-based access control enforced via FastAPI middleware (`require_role`).
- Only authorized roles can access sensitive endpoints (e.g., task assignment, billing, calendar sync).

## Input Validation
- All external inputs (email, voice transcripts, calendar events) validated using strict Pydantic schemas.
- Email addresses are syntax-checked and subject/body fields are sanitized for XSS and code injection.
- Voice transcripts are length-checked and sanitized to prevent malicious payloads.
- Calendar event data (title, description, times, attendee emails) validated for correct format and safe content.

## Recommendations
- Rotate JWT secret regularly and store in secure environment variables.
- Audit endpoint access and monitor for unauthorized attempts.
- Validate all third-party API responses before storing or acting upon data.
