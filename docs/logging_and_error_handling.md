# Logging, Error Handling, and Retry Mechanisms

## Logging Strategy
- Centralized, consistent logging using Python's `logging` module.
- Log levels: DEBUG (development), INFO (operational), WARNING (recoverable issues), ERROR (failures), CRITICAL (systemic outages).
- All module-level loggers obtained via `get_logger()`.
- Logs include timestamp, level, and source module.

## Error Handling
- Custom exceptions for domain-specific error clarity (e.g., `ExternalAPIError`, `TransientError`, `PermanentError`, `GracefulDegradation`).
- Try/except blocks wrap all integration points.
- All exceptions logged appropriately with stack traces for unexpected failures.

## Retry Policies
- Decorator-based retry mechanism for transient errors, with exponential backoff.
- Max attempts and backoff factor are configurable per integration.
- Retries only for errors marked as transient.

## Graceful Degradation
- If maximum retries are exhausted, the system can either:
  - inform users of degraded functionality,
  - fallback to cached/stale data if available,
  - or provide informative error responses to the client.

## Integration Example
Each external API integration uses the above patterns. Replace simulated API call placeholders with actual SDK/http calls and customize error parsing as needed.
