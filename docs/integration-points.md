# Integration Points & External API Considerations

## 1. Google Workspace
- **Calendar**: Create/read/update/delete events for appointments.
- **Contacts**: Fetch/update contact details for users and participants.
- **Drive**: Store relevant files/documents (if required).

## 2. Twilio
- **SMS/Voice**: Send/receive messages and voice calls for reminders, confirmations, and notifications.

## 3. Stripe
- **Payments**: Process card payments, manage invoices, and track payment status for billable services.

## 4. SendGrid
- **Email**: Send transactional emails (appointment confirmations, reminders, receipts).

## 5. Integration Patterns
- Use GCP Secret Manager for API credentials.
- Implement retries with exponential backoff.
- Monitor rate limits and handle errors gracefully.
- Abstract integration logic into dedicated services/microservices for maintainability.
