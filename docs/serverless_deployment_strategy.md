# Serverless Deployment Strategy

## Overview
All agents are deployed as GCP Cloud Functions (or Cloud Run for higher concurrency/latency tolerance), triggered by Pub/Sub topics. This ensures horizontal scalability, fault isolation, and cost-efficient operations.

## Components

- **Cloud Functions**: Each agent is a stateless function triggered by specific Pub/Sub topics.
- **Firestore**: Used for persistent storage of agent state, knowledge base, and operational records.
- **Pub/Sub**: Backbone for agent-to-agent asynchronous communication.
- **Third-Party APIs**: Integrate securely via service accounts and secrets (Google Calendar, Stripe, Twilio, etc).

## Deployment Best Practices
- **Function Granularity**: Deploy each agent as an independent function for isolation and scaling.
- **Environment Management**: Use separate GCP projects or environments for dev/staging/prod. Manage secrets via Secret Manager.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Use GCP Cloud Logging and Monitoring to track function health, Pub/Sub queue status, and errors.
- **Error Handling**: Configure dead-letter topics for failed Pub/Sub messages. Implement retries/backoff for transient API failures.
- **Backups**: Schedule regular Firestore backups and export configuration snapshots.
- **IAM & Security**: Apply least-privilege IAM roles for agents and external API access. Restrict network egress as needed.

## Scaling & Reliability
- Functions auto-scale with Pub/Sub message volume.
- Firestore provides strong consistency and multi-region availability.
- Pub/Sub ensures at-least-once delivery; design idempotent function handlers.

## Cost Controls
- Use Pub/Sub filtering to reduce unnecessary function invocations.
- Monitor function execution time and optimize code for cold start performance.

## Example Deployment Workflow
1. Push code to Git repository.
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys Cloud Functions, updating triggers as needed.
3. Configuration (API keys, endpoints) stored in Secret Manager and injected as environment variables.
