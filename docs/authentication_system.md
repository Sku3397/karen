# Authentication System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details of the OAuth 2.0 and JWT token authentication system with role-based access control for the AI Handyman Secretary Assistant project.

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
The OAuth 2.0 authentication is handled by `OAuth2Server` class in `src/auth/oauth2.py`. This class uses the `oauthlib` library to implement the OAuth 2.0 server functionality.

### JWT Token Handling
JWT tokens are generated and decoded using the `jwt_handler.py` script. This script utilizes the `PyJWT` library for handling JWT encoding and decoding.

### Role-Based Access Control
Role-based access control is implemented in `role_based_access_control.py`. This module defines different roles and their permissions within the application.
